Although the capital has the highest concentration of Airbnb listings in the world, it has also been badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Brexit. In order to remain well established and keep its staff's jobs secure, Airbnb relies on new hosts signing up and needs existing hosts to be active on the platform.
